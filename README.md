CIFReader
=========

This is a Java version of CIFReader, a previous project written in C++ used to serve my needs. Many people (myself included) felt that it was a bit of a kludge and an absolute arse to build. So here's a Java version. I invite anyone to take over the C++ project, as this will be the primary project moving on.

Please contact me if you use the software, I'd love to know where. Email address is tom@swlines.co.uk.
